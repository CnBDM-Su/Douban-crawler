## Features

   * Distributed Crawling: Given that the data is of overwhelming size, distributed cralwing is inevitable for our project.

   * Robustness: Douban has its anti-robots scheme, e.g. Crawl-delay: 5, therefore strategies like changing user-agent and proxy ip etc. are siginificant in our crawling practice.
